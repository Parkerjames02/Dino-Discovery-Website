                This website was created for the user to quickly learn about which <br> dinosaurs lived during
                which time period. On the homepage the user can choose from the Triassic Period, Jurassic
                Period, and Cretaceous Period. There are <br> also little pictures that go along with every name
                so that the user will get an understanding of how each dinosaur looks. More features may be
                added at a <br> future date.
